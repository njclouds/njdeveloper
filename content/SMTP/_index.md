### What is SMTP?

SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. It is a protocol for sending email messages between servers. Most email systems that send mail over the Internet use SMTP to send messages from one server to another, and to deliver messages to local mail clients like Microsoft Outlook or Apple Mail. SMTP is a text-based protocol, and it uses several commands that are sent to the server to perform different functions, such as sending and receiving messages.
